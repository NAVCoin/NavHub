title: "Monthly News Submission Deadline 001"
location: "NavCoin Discord #social-media"
host: "NavCoin Core"
description: "Federating the Monthly News. NavCoin is a community driven project, it makes some sense to make the monthly newsletter a federated publication based on user submissions.
This means it is each community members responsibility when you have some news to share about progress in your NavCoin project, an exchange listing you’ve helped secure, the community fund / payment proposal you’ve submitted, the youtube video you’ve made, the article you’ve written or anything you’ve contributed to the NavCoin project, you would submit a brief write up here which will then appear in the next monthly newsletter. The deadline for submissions is the third Tuesday of every month with the newsletter being published on the third Wednesday of every month and syndicated through all of our social channels, mailing lists and websites."
