    <span>NavCoin and its eco-system of projects are all open source. If you want to contribute to any of these projects you can via the <a href="https://github.com/NAVCoin" target="e">NavCoin GitHub</a> repositories. If you’re working on your own NavCoin project, talk with the community on the <a href="https://discord.gg/y4Vu9jw" target="e">NavCoin Discord</a> and we can help you add it to the&nbsp;roadmap!</span>
